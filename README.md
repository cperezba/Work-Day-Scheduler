## <a id="description-header"></a> Description

As a means of learning local storage and jQuery, it seemed appropriate to make a work day scheduler! Local storage was used as a means of saving a user's text entry. Instead of JavaScript, the back-end code being used to power this application is jQuery.

This simple application's purpose is to create a daily work scheduler. It takes in a user's input and saves it to local storage, therefore preserving it for the next time the user logs into the webpage. It also provides a visual rubric - updated in real time - that marks out the hours in a color codes.
